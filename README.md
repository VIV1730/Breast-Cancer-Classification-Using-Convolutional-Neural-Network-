# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Network

## Overview
Breast cancer ranks as the most prevalent cancer and the second largest contributor to women's cancer-related fatalities. breast cancer has a high mortality rate and a low survival rate, early detection is essential. Predicting and diagnosing breast cancer early has been the main use of deep learning algorithms. This work suggests a better method for classifying breast cancer using a Breast Cancer Convolutional Neural Network (BC-CNN). 

When working with the Breast Cancer Dataset, preprocessing techniques such picture scaling are applied. Using the pre-processed dataset, the BC-CNN, a technique for categorizing breast cancer patients into four groups invasive, in situ, and normal will be trained.

The objective of this suggested methodology is to increase the precision and dependability of breast cancer diagnosis, enabling prompt intervention and individualized treatment plans according to the individualstage of the illness. The accuracy of the suggested method is assessed by comparing it to the capsule network.
